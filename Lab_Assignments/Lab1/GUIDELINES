Information for Coding Lab 1 (Kindly read carefully)

This is to inform you that your coding lab 1 will be held on codeforces . The contest will start on Friday at 3pm and you will get 48 hours to solve the same . The languages allowed are C, C++ and Java.

In order to access the lab you will have to join the ADA [2024] grp on codeforces . The invite link to join the grp has already been sent to everyone on their cf ids that you filled in the gform . You can access the invite on the Groups tab (which is present on the top header bar of Codeforces when you login).

To help you get accustomed to the platform as well as to test our servers we have created a demo lab which starts at 10pm today and runs for 1 day . Kindly attempt the same to avoid any problems during the actual lab.
